A rose is crying for love
But no matter how hard it tries
War will never end for us
I see hell in your eyes
Love will never melt your heart
You live your life in the dark
The same old story, the same old whinning
I cannot believe it I gotta say goodbye

Alo, alo, alo, S.O.S
I was not supposed to be in love
And this is my regret
Alo, alo, alo, S.O.S
He will never be the one for me
And now I’m in distress

Alo, alo. alo, S.O.S
Alo, alo, alo
Alo, alo, alo, S.O.S
He’ll never be the one to take away my loneliness

I know the end is near
So don’t keep us waiting
You know I couldn’t bear to see my heart breaking
And if you wanna be free just pack your bags and leave me
You’ll see no tears in my eyes
Even though I know this will never be easy
I’m still in love with your lies

Alo, alo, alo, S.O.S
I was not supposed to be in love
And this is my regret
Alo, alo, alo, S.O.S
He will never be the one for me
And now I’m in distress

Alo, alo. alo, S.O.S
Alo, alo, alo
Alo, alo, alo, S.O.S
He’ll never be the one to take away my loneliness

Under the water In the deep sea
I’m slowly drowning, I can’t breathe
Under the bridge of broken dreams
I’m slowly falling down on my knees
Under the water In the deep sea
I’m slowly drowning, I can’t breathe
Under the bridge of broken dreams
I’m slowly falling down on my knees

Alo, alo, alo, S.O.S
I was not supposed to be in love
And this is my regret
Alo, alo, alo, S.O.S
He will never be the one for me
And now I’m in distress

Alo, alo. alo, S.O.S
Alo, alo, alo
Alo, alo, alo, S.O.S
He’ll never be the one to take away my loneliness.
