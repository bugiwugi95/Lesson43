Hi Barbie!
Hi Ken!
Do you wanna go for a ride?
Sure Ken!
Jump In…
I’m a barbie girl, in a barbie world
Life in plastic, it’s fantastic!
You can brush my hair,
Undress me everywhere
Imagination, life is your creation
Come on Barbie, let’s go party!
I’m a barbie girl, in a barbie world
Life in plastic, it’s fantastic!
You can brush my hair,
Undress me everywhere
Imagination, life is your creation
I’m a blond single girl, in a fantasy world
Dress me up, make it tight, I’m your dolly
You’re my doll, rock’n’roll, feel the glamour in pink,
Kiss me here, touch me there, hanky panky
You can touch, you can play, if you say: «I’m always yours»
I’m a barbie girl, in a barbie world
Life in plastic, it’s fantastic!
You can brush my hair,
Undress me everywhere
Imagination, life is your creation
Make me walk, make me talk,
I’ll do whatever you please
I can act like a star, I can beg on my knees
Come jump in, bimbo friend, let us do it again,
Hit the town, fool around, let’s go party
Come on Barbie, let’s go party!
I’m a barbie girl, in a barbie world
Life in plastic, it’s fantastic!
You can brush my hair,
Undress me everywhere
Imagination, life is your creation
Oh, I’m having so much fun!
Well Barbie, we’re just getting started
Oh, I love you Ken!
