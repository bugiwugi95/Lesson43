Aqua-Barbie Girl: 
— Hi Barbie!
— Hi Ken!
— Do you wanna go for a ride?
— Sure Ken!
— Jump In…

I’m a barbie girl, in a barbie world
Life in plastic, it’s fantastic!
You can brush my hair,
Undress me everywhere
Imagination, life is your creation

Come on Barbie, let’s go party!

I’m a barbie girl, in a barbie world
Life in plastic, it’s fantastic!
You can brush my hair,
Undress me everywhere
Imagination, life is your creation

I’m a blond single girl, in a fantasy world
Dress me up, make it tight, I’m your dolly
You’re my doll, rock’n’roll, feel the glamour in pink,
Kiss me here, touch me there, hanky panky
You can touch, you can play, if you say: «I’m always yours»

I’m a barbie girl, in a barbie world
Life in plastic, it’s fantastic!
You can brush my hair,
Undress me everywhere
Imagination, life is your creation

Make me walk, make me talk,
I’ll do whatever you please
I can act like a star, I can beg on my knees
Come jump in, bimbo friend, let us do it again,
Hit the town, fool around, let’s go party
— Come on Barbie, let’s go party!

I’m a barbie girl, in a barbie world
Life in plastic, it’s fantastic!
You can brush my hair,
Undress me everywhere
Imagination, life is your creation

-Oh, I’m having so much fun!
-Well Barbie, we’re just getting started
-Oh, I love you Ken!

Aris-S.O.S:
A rose is crying for love
But no matter how hard it tries
War will never end for us
I see hell in your eyes
Love will never melt your heart
You live your life in the dark
The same old story, the same old whinning
I cannot believe it I gotta say goodbye

Alo, alo, alo, S.O.S
I was not supposed to be in love
And this is my regret
Alo, alo, alo, S.O.S
He will never be the one for me
And now I’m in distress

Alo, alo. alo, S.O.S
Alo, alo, alo
Alo, alo, alo, S.O.S
He’ll never be the one to take away my loneliness

I know the end is near
So don’t keep us waiting
You know I couldn’t bear to see my heart breaking
And if you wanna be free just pack your bags and leave me
You’ll see no tears in my eyes
Even though I know this will never be easy
I’m still in love with your lies

Alo, alo, alo, S.O.S
I was not supposed to be in love
And this is my regret
Alo, alo, alo, S.O.S
He will never be the one for me
And now I’m in distress

Alo, alo. alo, S.O.S
Alo, alo, alo
Alo, alo, alo, S.O.S
He’ll never be the one to take away my loneliness

Under the water In the deep sea
I’m slowly drowning, I can’t breathe
Under the bridge of broken dreams
I’m slowly falling down on my knees
Under the water In the deep sea
I’m slowly drowning, I can’t breathe
Under the bridge of broken dreams
I’m slowly falling down on my knees

Alo, alo, alo, S.O.S
I was not supposed to be in love
And this is my regret
Alo, alo, alo, S.O.S
He will never be the one for me
And now I’m in distress

Alo, alo. alo, S.O.S
Alo, alo, alo
Alo, alo, alo, S.O.S
He’ll never be the one to take away my loneliness.

Avicii-	Broken Arrows:
You stripped your love down to the wire
Fire shy and cold alone outside
You stripped it right down to the wire
But I see you behind those tired eyes

Now as you wade through the shadows that live in your heart
You’ll find the light that leads home (home, home)
Cause I see you for you and your beautiful scars
So take my hand, don’t let go

Cause it’s not too late, it’s not too late
I, I see the hope in your heart
And sometimes you lose and sometimes you’re shooting
Broken arrows in the dark
But I, I see the hope in your heart

I’ve seen the darkness in the light
The kind of blue that leaves you lost and blind
The only thing that’s black and white
Is that you don’t have to walk alone this time

We have to tear down the walls that live in your heart
To find someone you call home (home, home)
Now you see me for me and my beautiful scars
So take my hand, don’t let go

Cause it’s not too late, it’s not too late
I, I see the hope in your heart
And sometimes you lose and sometimes you’re shooting
Broken arrows in the dark
But I, I see the hope in your heart

It’s not too late, it’s not too late
I see the hope in your heart
Sometimes you’re losing, sometimes shooting
Broken arrows in the dark.
